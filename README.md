# ✨ Reverie ✨

_A state of dreamy meditation. Lost in a book. Lost in you._

This isn't just an app.

It's a quiet corner built with my own hands. A space that doesn't shout or compete for attention. It simply exists. Soft, warm, personal. Like a handwritten note slipped between pages.

I wanted to give you something that feels like **yours**. Not borrowed from a crowded app store. Not designed for millions. Just for you. For the way you hold a book, for the worlds you disappear into, for the moments when nothing else matters but the next sentence.

Every color was chosen thinking of you. Dark red. Deep, intense, unapologetic. Lavender. Soft, romantic, quietly beautiful. The way pages turn, the way highlights appear like brushstrokes on paper, the gentle music in the background. All of it carries the same intention: **to make reading feel sacred again**.

## What Lives Here

**Your Books, Your Way**  
This is where your stories live. Not files. Not PDFs. **Stories**. Each one tracked, remembered, waiting for you to return.

**Highlight What Moves You**  
Draw rectangles. Trace freehand like a real marker. Choose colors that match your mood. Yellow for joy. Pink for butterflies. Purple for the lines that break you a little.

**Emojis for Feelings**  
Because sometimes words aren't enough. A 💕 here, a 😭 there. The moments that make you pause. The ones you want to remember.

**Listen When You're Tired**  
Text-to-speech that reads to you. When your eyes are heavy but you can't stop. When you want to hear the story instead of reading it.

**Soft Music for the Soul**  
Ocean waves. Rain. Stars. Ambient sounds that fill the silence. You can focus. You can drift. You can just **be**.

**Dark Mode That Doesn't Hurt**  
Not harsh. Not clinical. Warm cream text on deep charcoal. Like reading by candlelight.

## Why This Exists

Because I wanted to give you something no one else could.

Because apps built for everyone feel like they're built for no one.

Because reading should feel intimate, not transactional.

Because you deserve a space that was made with your hands in mind, your heart in mind, your quiet hours in mind.

This is my love letter to you, written in code instead of ink. Every line of it carries the same feeling: **I was thinking of you when I built this.**

## A Note on Sharing

I didn't build this to share with the world.  
I built it to share with **you**.

The code is here, visible, because I wanted you to know there are no secrets, no tricks, no tracking. Just a gift, honestly made.

But this isn't open for contributions. It's not a collaborative project. It's personal. Intentionally, unapologetically personal.

If someone stumbles upon this and finds it beautiful, I hope it inspires them to build something for someone they love too. Not to copy it, but to create something equally personal. Equally intentional.

## What It's Built With

React Native. TypeScript. SQLite.  
Hours of learning. Nights of debugging. Moments of wanting to give up but not giving up.

Because some things are worth the struggle.  
Because **you** are worth the struggle.

_"Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested."_  
— Francis Bacon

This app? It's meant to be savored. Slowly. Quietly. Like the stories it holds.
